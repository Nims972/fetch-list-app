This is the homework activity for fetch android developer intern.

I have created native android app using Java and XML for design. Task was to fetch json from URL and display it in group of listid.

I have grouped items basis listid, and upon click of listid ,it shows the list of items under it where listid was same.
I have done name ordering as well, this is lexicographic ordering and not the "pure number" ordering

I have placed initiation of fetchdata in oncreate itself, hence when app opens it will fetch the data and display it like below.

we can click the listid and items will be listed below it.
